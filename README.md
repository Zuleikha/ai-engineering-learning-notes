# AI Engineering Learning Notes

These notes document my understanding of AI/ML systems studied during my PG Diploma in AI
(National College of Ireland).  
This repository contains **learning documentation only**.  
I do not claim authorship of any referenced coursework code.

## Scope
- Multi-target / multi-label learning
- Classical ML models & ensembles
- Evaluation strategies
- Codebase structure & design patterns

## Source Context
Some notes are based on studying a college-provided project for
*Engineering and Evaluating Artificial Intelligence (PGDAI)*.
